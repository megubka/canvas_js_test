# Introduction:

Create a UI that will generate a viewport with pictures on it. How it should work:

1. The wall/floor is seen in the viewport.
2. The floor is made up of tiles.
3. The floor is endless and moves toward the left continuously.
4. The tile set is generated randomly from a pool of 8 PNG files.
5. It's important to use the least possible amount of tiles declared at the same time in the browser's memory.
